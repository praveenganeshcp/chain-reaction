# Chain Reaction
> This game was built for learning the low level system design and OOP concepts

Players take turns to place "arbs" of the corresponding color in the cells. A cell explodes if it reaches the threshold, emitting the arbs to the adjacent cells also changing their color respective to exploded arb. This reaction takes place recursively until all the cells become stable.
